  This is a project-based, guided introduction to Melange and its ecosystem. Because Melange uses both OCaml and JavaScript ecosystems, there are quite a few tools and concepts to learn. Therefore we try to make each chapter small and digestible, not introducing too many things at once.
recommendation: >
  To start reading this guide, you should already know how to make frontend applications in JavaScript, in particular with React. You should be interested in learning how to leverage your existing knowledge to build apps using ReasonReact. You do not need to know OCaml—we’ll slowly introduce the basics of the language throughout the tutorial. That said, a good complement to this guide is OCaml Programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful, which teaches the language from the ground up and goes much deeper into its features.

This book is a work in progress. New chapters are added every month.

This is a project-based, guided introduction to [Melange](https://melange.re) and its ecosystem (Melange is a compiler that translates OCaml code into JavaScript). Because Melange uses both OCaml and JavaScript ecosystems, there are quite a few tools and concepts to learn. Therefore we try to make each chapter small and digestible, not introducing too many things at once.

Before reading this guide, you should already know how to make frontend applications in JavaScript, in particular with [React](https://react.dev/). You should be interested in learning how to leverage your existing knowledge to build apps using [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/). You do not need to know OCaml—we’ll slowly introduce the basics of the language throughout the tutorial. That said, a good complement to this guide is [OCaml Programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/), which teaches the language from the ground up and goes much deeper into its features.

Because of the focus on ReasonReact, we won't cover traditional OCaml syntax in this guide. Instead, we'll cover the [Reason syntax](https://reasonml.github.io/) which works great with ReasonReact because of its first-class support for JSX.
